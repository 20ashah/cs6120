The ASPLOS 2009 paper [“Producing Wrong Data Without Doing Anything Obviously Wrong!”][paper] by [Mytkowicz][toddm] et al. is a modern classic and one of my favorite papers to recommend.
Instead of selling it to you anew, I’m going to refer you to [a blog post I wrote about it last year][2019post].
It’s still good—I swear!

After I wrote that blog post, someone referred me to a kind of kindred-spirit article: [John Ousterhout][ousterhout]’s 2018 CACM screed, [“Always Measure One Level Deeper”][ousterhout-cacm].
I recommend it if you want a perspective that takes the terrifying realizations from Mytkowicz et al. and turns them into concrete advice.
