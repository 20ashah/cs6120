The goal of this project was to optimize Bril programs with profile-guided
function reordering and basic block reordering to improve code locality. I used
[Bril()](/blog/making-function-calls-work) to serve as a base for the
optimization since it allows for function calls and passing in input via the
command line.

### Defining Code Locality
Before moving further, it is important to clearly define what "code locality"
means. Typically, the goal of code layout optimizations is to improve
instruction cache and instruction TLB utilization. When an instruction is loaded
into the instruction cache, a block of instructions are loaded into the cache
(known as a cache line). To improve cache utilization, we want to minimize the
number of times we load into the instruction cache. In other words, we want
sequences of instructions that frequently run together to live close together in
the code.

That being said, there are many factors that make measuring this metric
difficult for this project. Firstly, since Bril is interpreted, we do not load
Bril instructions directly into the instruction cache. I considered lowering
Bril programs to LLVM using a project 1 extension and then evaluating the
lowered program, but that leads into the second problem: I am one person running
Bril programs on one machine. The results I find for my machine may not be
consistent with other machines, so results would be misleading. Because of this,
I use a different metric to measure code locality: *instruction pointer jumps*.
Improving code layout usually decreases the total number of instruction pointer
jumps, since frequently executed code lives close together. To introduce the
notion of an instruction pointer to the interpreter, I use the index of the
currently executing instruction. Every time an instruction is executed, we can
compare the current instruction pointer location to the previous location to
determine the number of instruction pointer jumps. In other words, we are
measuring the distance between the current instruction and the previously
executed instruction.


### Design

The designs of these optimizations are closely related to the optimizations
discussed in ["Profile guided code
positioning"](https://doi.org/10.1145/93542.93550) (1990) by Pettis and Hansen
and ["Optimizing function placement for large-scale data-center
applications"](https://research.fb.com/publications/optimizing-function-placement-for-large-scale-data-center-applications-2/)
(2017) by Ottoni and Maher. Specifically, the basic block reordering
optimization follows the approach laid out the first paper, and the function
reordering optimization follows the approach in the second paper. Both
optimizations are profile-guided, meaning they use sample inputs to make
optimization decisions. Assuming that real-world workloads mirror the sample
inputs, we can optimize the code layout for the sample inputs, and this should
lead to improved performance on real workloads.

### Profiling

The first step in any profile-guided optimization is—perhaps
unsurprisingly—profiling. But first, we need to know what kind of data we want
to collect when profiling Bril programs. Function reordering relies on weighted
directed call graphs, where nodes represent functions, edges represent calls
from one function to another, and edge weights are the number of times that call
occurred in the sample workload. Similarly, basic block reordering relies on
weighted control flow graphs, where edge weights are the number of times the
corresponding branch was taken. Therefore, when profiling a Bril program, we
would like to keep track of function calls and branches. In addition, to help
with evaluation, we will keep track of the total number of instruction pointer
jumps.

To build a Bril profiler, I first extended the parser to create an annotated
JSON representation of the program. I introduced a new `"block"` key for every
instruction, denoting which basic block each instruction belongs to, and a
`"line"` key, denoting the line number of the instruction (ignoring whitespace)
in Bril's JSON representation. In other words, "line" points to the index of the
instruction in the program. The first instruction in the first function is `1`,
the second is `2`, and so on. I then extended the interpreter to accept
profiling data in the form of a line-separated list of command-line arguments.
It then passes each line of the profiling data to the program, tracking function
calls and basic block changes. The profiler returns a JSON representation of the
weighted call and control flow graphs. The format of the profiling output is
shown below.

```
{
  "call_graph": [
    {
      "from": caller name,
      "to": callee name,
      "count": total number of times called
    },
    ...
  ],
  "basic_block_flows": [
    {
      "from": block label,
      "to": block label,
      "count": total number of times branched,
      "function": function where "from" and "to" blocks live
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total_ip_jumps": total number of instruction pointer jumps
}
```

To decouple the interpreter from the profiler, I created a new command called
`brilprofile`. It reads Bril programs as JSON from `stdin` (like `brili`), but
it takes an additional argument, a path to the sample workload. For example,
suppose we have a program called `fibonacci.bril` that takes an integer as a
command-line argument. If we have a workload `fibonacci.in` that contains
line-separated integers, we could profile the program by running:

```
bril2json < fibonacci.bril | brilprofile fibonacci.in
```

Let's first take a look at how basic block reordering and function reordering
are done, and then we'll run through an example from start to end.

### Basic Block Reordering
Basic block reordering uses a weighted control flow graph to determine which
basic blocks should be close to each other. We want basic blocks that frequently
run one after another to live closer together. As a result, it makes sense to
co-locate basic blocks that have higher-weighted edges. To do this, I followed a
greedy approach introduced by [Pettis and
Hansen](https://doi.org/10.1145/93542.93550). At a high-level, it works by
coalescing basic blocks into chains and ordering these chains to form the new
block order. Initially, each basic block belongs to its own chain. We define the
*source* node of a chain as the *last* node, and the *target* node as the
*first* node. Note that initially every block is a source and a target. Then,
the algorithm works as follows.

1. Iterate over edges in decreasing order of weight.
2. During each iteration, if the tail of the edge is a source and the head is a
   target, then combine the two chains into one chain.
3. Continue until no more chains can be coalesced.
4. Order the remaining chains based on frequency of execution. More frequently
   run chains should be placed higher in the function.

One exception to the above is that the first block in a function must remain the
first block in a function since it is the function's entry point. As a result,
it must always be a target node, and its chain must be explicitly placed at the
top of the function.

### Function Reordering
Function reordering uses a weighted call graph to determine an improved function
order. The approach is similar to that of basic block reordering. I followed the
approach laid out by [Ottoni and
Maher](https://research.fb.com/publications/optimizing-function-placement-for-large-scale-data-center-applications-2/),
with some modifications to account for the limitations of the Bril interpreter.
Function reordering works as follows:

1. For each node, we assign a "hotness" metric, defined as the sum of their
   incoming edge weights.
2. Iterate over the nodes in decreasing order of hotness.
3. During each iteration, determine the node's highest-weight incoming edge, and
   coalesced the node with the source of the edge.
   - Each node has a memory of the order in which nodes are coalesced. For
     example, if the edge is (`a`, `b`), then after coalescing, the new node
     will record that `b` is ordered after `a`.
4. Continue until no edges remain.

The final node's order is the function order. The difference in this approach
compared to the one in the paper is that the paper incorporates page sizes in
its ordering. Since we do not have the notion of a page in the Bril interpreter,
I just ignore that. The above algorithm is the same as the one in the paper if
we assume unlimited page sizes.

### An example
To get a better idea of how these optimizations work, let's run through an
example from start to end. The following Bril program takes in two command-line
arguments `a` and `b`, and computes `exp(a, b)`.

```
multiply a b : int {
  zero: int = const 0;
  one: int = const 1;
  curr: int = id zero;
start:
  b_zero: bool = eq b zero;
  br b_zero end cont;
end:
  ret curr;
cont:
  curr: int = add curr a;
  b: int = sub b one;
  jmp start;
}

main base exp {
  zero: int = const 0;
  one: int = const 1;
  val: int = const 1;
start:
  exp_zero: bool = eq exp zero;
  br exp_zero end cont;
end:
  print val;
  ret;
cont:
  val: int = call multiply val base;
  exp: int = sub exp one;
  jmp start;
}
```

Below is the workload we will use to profile the program.

```
2 4
4 2
5 5
6 6
2 9
3 9
4 10
2 20
2 10
3 7
```

Now, if we run `brilprofile` on the program with the above workload, we will get
the following call graph.

<p align="center">
  <img src="call-graph.png" style="width: 95px">
</p>

The function reordering algorithm will place `main` before `multiply`, since
`main` calls `multiply`.

Below is the basic block graph for `main`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="main-block-graph.png" style="width: 450px">
</p>

The basic block reordering algorithm will first coalesce `start` and `cont` and
then prepend `b1` to that chain. Since `end` cannot be added to this chain, it
will remain on its own. Combining the chains will lead to a final block order of
`b1`, `start`, `cont`, and `end`.

Below is the basic block graph for `multiply`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="multiply-block-graph.png" style="width: 450px">
</p>

This is very similar to the weighted CFG for `main`. The output block order is
the same: `b1`, `start`, `cont`, and `end`.

Putting all this together, the optimized Bril program is below (after running
*both* function reordering and block reordering).

```
main {
  zero: int = const 0;
  one: int = const 1;
  val: int = const 1;
start:
  exp_zero: bool = eq exp zero;
  br exp_zero end cont;
cont:
  val: int = call multiply val base;
  exp: int = sub exp one;
  jmp start;
end:
  print val;
  ret ;
}
multiply {
  zero: int = const 0;
  one: int = const 1;
  curr: int = id zero;
start:
  b_zero: bool = eq b zero;
  br b_zero end cont;
cont:
  curr: int = add curr a;
  b: int = sub b one;
  jmp start;
end:
  ret curr;
}
```

When testing, I found the above program to have 29% fewer instruction pointer
jumps than the unoptimized program when run on the same workload. We will now
explore the evaluation of these optimizations.

### Evaluation
I evaluated these optimizations by comparing the total number of instruction
pointer jumps for the unoptimized and optimized programs on a given workload. I
wrote six Bril programs and ran each with three workloads. On average, across
all programs and workloads, function reordering decreased the total number of
instruction pointer jumps by 7.7% with a standard deviation of 36%. Basic block
reordering decreased the number of instruction pointer jumps by approximately
19%, with a standard deviation of 12%. Since the two optimizations do not
interfere with each other, I also evaluated the combination of function
reordering and basic block reordering, and found an average instruction pointer
jump decrease of 12%, with a standard deviation of 35%. The high standard
deviation of function reordering indicates that its performance is quite
inconsistent and that the reordering algorithm has some serious flaws. I discuss
this near the end of this section.

To conduct a thorough and rigorous evaluation of these optimizations, I ran them
on numerous benchmark programs with various workloads. My evaluation strategy
for a specific program was the following:
1. Profile the original program with a sample workload.
2. Run the function reordering optimization and profile with the same workload.
3. Repeat step 2 but with basic block reordering.
4. Repeat step 2 but run both optimizations one after another. Note that since
   the optimizations do not interfere, the order in which we apply the
   optimizations does not matter.
5. Repeat for all workloads.

I considered testing the optimized programs with a different "testing" workload
but decided that this would not fairly evaluate the optimizations. Since we make
the assumption that sample workloads are representative of real-world workloads,
we should stick to that assumption.

Below is a graph showing the results of function and block reordering for 6
representative programs on three different workloads. Due to the lack of
existing Bril programs to benchmark, I wrote the programs and their workloads.
Each bar represents the corresponding program's average *normalized* number of
instruction pointer jumps for the workloads, and the error bars represent the
standard error. To normalize the instruction pointer jumps, I divided by the
unoptimized program's number of instruction pointer jumps. This makes it easier
to compare results for different workloads, as larger workloads will naturally
have more total instruction pointer jumps. The last two programs do not contain
any functions. Programs and workloads can be found
[here](https://github.com/Blue9/bril/tree/project-2/workload).

<p align="center">
  <img src="code-layout-evaluation.png" style="width: 100%">
</p>

Note that the error bars for most programs are very small. The "Loop" test had
quite large error bars, and this is because one of the workloads only ran one
iteration of the loop, and this led to branching behavior to be quite different
from the other workloads. For this workload, block reordering only gave a 0.6%
increase in performance. This is important to note because it shows how the
performance of the code layout optimizations is sensitive to the workloads.

From the above, we can see that the basic block reordering optimization
consistently decreases the number of instruction pointer jumps by 10-20% (with
the exception of the first test, which could not benefit from branch
reordering), but the function reordering optimization is inconsistent. For
"Fib", the function reordering optimization increased the number of instruction
pointer jumps by approximately 59% on average. Below is the "Fib" benchmark.

```
main (n:int) {
  v1: int = call fib n;
  print v1;
}
le_one (n: int): bool {
  one: int = const 1;
  lto: bool = le n one;
  ret lto;
}
fib n: int {
  base: bool = call le_one n;
  br base return continue;
return:
  ret n;
continue:
  one: int = const 1;
  prev: int = sub n one;
  prev2: int = sub prev one;
  fib1: int = call fib prev;
  fib2: int = call fib prev2;
  ans: int = add fib1 fib2;
  ret ans;
}
```

And below is the `optimized` program returned by the function reordering
algorithm.

```
main (n:int) {
  v1: int = call fib n;
  print v1;
}
fib n: int {
  base: bool = call le_one n;
  br base return continue;
return:
  ret n;
continue:
  one: int = const 1;
  prev: int = sub n one;
  prev2: int = sub prev one;
  fib1: int = call fib prev;
  fib2: int = call fib prev2;
  ans: int = add fib1 fib2;
  ret ans;
}
le_one (n: int): bool {
  one: int = const 1;
  lto: bool = le n one;
  ret lto;
}
```

Intuitively, this reordering makes sense. `main` calls `fib`, and `fib` calls
`le_one`. However, note the location in `fib` where `le_one` is called. It is at
the very top of the function—the first line in fact. As a result, when this call
is made, the instruction pointer has to go down the entirety of `fib` to get to
`le_one`, and then it has to go all the way back when `le_one` returns. In the
original program, the instruction pointer only had to traverse the length of
`le_one`, which is considerably shorter than `fib`. This demonstrates one of the
core weaknesses of this function reordering algorithm. It assumes that all
functions are of the same length and that on average, function calls are made
halfway through a function. However, in real programs, this is rarely the case.
I think it would be interesting to explore this further and see how we could
incorporate the size of functions as well as the location of function calls to
improve function ordering.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, basic block reordering consistently decreased the total number of
instruction pointer jumps, indicating that it improved code locality. On the
other hand, function reordering did not always improve code locality, and in one
case, increased the number of instruction pointer jumps by almost 60%. It would
be interesting to investigate how function reordering could be improved to
account for function lengths and function call locations. Ultimately, I found
implementing these optimizations to be very interesting as they are quite
different from classic optimizations.
