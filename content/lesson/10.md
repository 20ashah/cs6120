## Tasks

* Implement a garbage collector for the Bril interpreter and the Bril [memory extension][mem], eliminating the need for the `free` instruction. Stick with something simple, like reference counting or a semispace collector.
* Check that it works by running test programs that use memory after deleting all their `free` instructions.
