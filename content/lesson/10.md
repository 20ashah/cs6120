## Gist

* The calamitous failure of manual memory management.
    * See, for example, this [finding from Microsoft that 70% of their CVEs are from memory safety bugs][ms-bugs].
    * The vast majority of languages today have either (a) manual memory management, or (b) automatic, dynamic memory management. Automatic, static memory management is mostly the domain of [Rust][].
* Approaches to garbage collection.
  * Reference counting. Reference cycles.
  * Mark/sweep.
    * Basic.
    * Moving/copying.
      * Semispace.
      * Compacting.
      * Generational.
* Conservative vs. precise collectors.

## Tasks

* Implement a garbage collector for the Bril interpreter and the Bril [memory extension][mem], eliminating the need for the `free` instruction. Stick with something simple, like reference counting or a semispace collector.
* Check that it works by running test programs that use memory after deleting all their `free` instructions.
