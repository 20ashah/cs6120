## Gist

* Control flow analysis.
  * Dominators & post-dominators.
  * An algorithm for finding dominators.
* Static single assignment (SSA) form.
  * Defining SSA.
  * Derive the algorithms for converting to and from SSA.
  * An application: global value numbering.

## Tasks

* Implement the algorithm for finding dominators. For bonus “points,” also try computing the dominance tree and the domination frontier.
* Implement the “into SSA” and “out of SSA” transformations on Bril functions.
