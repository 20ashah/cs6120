## Gist

* How do you represent a program?
    * Concrete syntax.
    * AST.
    * Instructions.
* [Bril][] is a language invented for 6120.
    * Philosophy.
        * The canonical representation is JSON. There is a text format, but that's just a detail. This class is not about parsing. If you ever find yourself doing something fancy with the text format, stop—that's not your job.
        * A consequence is that you can (and should!) start "from scratch" with Bril. Do not attempt to use my garbage Python stuff; write your own!
* [Turnt][] is a tool you might like for testing compiler tools.


## Tasks

Your goal is to get familiar with [Bril][].

* Write a new benchmark.
    * You can write it by hand, use the [TypeScript compiler][ts2bril], or generate it some other way.
    * Try running it with [brili][].
    * Open a pull request to add your new benchmark. Add your code to the [the `benchmarks` directory][benchdir] and mention it in [the docs][bmdocs].
* Write a program to analyze or transform Bril programs in some small way.
    * Pick your favorite programming language—there is no "starter code," so you can start from scratch.
    * Load up a JSON file. You can start with [this tiny one][add]!
    * Read [the docs][bril-docs].
    * Do something unambitious with it: count the number of add instructions, or add a `print` instruction before every jump, or whatever. Pick something small and contrived!
* Use [Turnt][] to test your new tool.
* Along the way, you will run into problems! Ask questions on [Zulip][], and open issues and pull requests to describe or fix problems. For example, even super simple benchmarks you might imagine probably can't be written easily because Bril is too simple. Mention this on Zulip, and consider pitching in to help add features.
* Write a short blog post about all of the above.
