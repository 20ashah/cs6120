## Gist

* Threads, shared-memory parallelism, and cache coherence. The end of Moore's law rears its cliché head.
* Sequential consistency and its discontents.
* Demonstrating a C program that violates SC.
* Threads cannot be implemented as a library.
* The C++11 memory model, DRF0, and DRF⇒SC.
* The Java memory model's long tale of woe.

## Tasks

There are no tasks for this lesson other than pondering the deep weirdness of shared memory programming.
Good luck on your course project!
