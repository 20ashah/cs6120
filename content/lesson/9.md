## Gist

* Stating the alias analysis problem. May alias & must alias.
* Instantiating data flow for intraprocedural alias analysis.
* Heap models. Context sensitivity.
* Scalable & precise alias analysis remains an open problem. For much more, see Smaragdakis and Balatsouras.

## Tasks

There are no implementation tasks for this lesson.
If alias analysis is your bag, you can start with using your data flow implementation to implement a straightforward may-alias analysis for [Bril pointers][mem], then proceed on to the literature to find and implement more and more interesting pointer analyses.
