## Gist

* Dynamic languages are popularâ€”dominant, maybe. And "interpreted languages" are not a thing anymore.
* Dynamic compilation: a problem and an opportunity.
* Method JITs & tracing JITs.
* Profiling & compilation tiers.

## Tasks

The task is to implement a *tracer* for Bril in the reference interpreter.
Your extended interpreter should run a program and, when execution finishes, produce an equivalent program that uses Bril's speculation extension to run some cast on a "fast path."

Here's a recipe:

* Start interpreting normally.
* At some point during execution (at the very beginning of `main`, for example, or when reaching a backedge), start tracing.
* While tracing, record every instruction as it executes. Eliminate jumps; replace branches with `guard` instructions.
* Stop tracing at some point (after a fixed number of instructions, for example, or at the next backedge).
* For bonus "points," optimize the trace by eliminating instructions that depend on foregone conclusions enforced by guards.
* Stitch the trace back into the program using `speculate` and `resolve` instructions.
* Convince yourself that your tracing is correct by running the Bril benchmarks on both old and new inputs.
