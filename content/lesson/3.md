### Intro & Simple DCE Passes

Contrasting local vs. global vs. interprocedural analysis.

Then, our first optimizations!

* Definition of dead code elimination (DCE).
* Globally unused instructions.
  * Derive an algorithm for deleting them.
  * Iterating to convergence.
  * Then implement it.
* Locally killed instructions.
  * The limits of local reasoning: why can't we do this globally?
  * Derive an algorithm for removing them.
  * Then implement that too.
* Let's try our new optimization pass out on the Bril benchmarks.
  * When working on your implementations, try them on [`simple.bril`](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril/blob/master/examples/test/tdce/simple.bril), [`reassign.bril`](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril/blob/master/examples/test/tdce/reassign.bril), and other examples in [the DCE test directory](https://github.com/sampsyo/bril/tree/master/examples/test/tdce) to see if they actually work.
  * First, combine all your implementations into one command somehow (including iterating to convergence). Try out your passâ€”something like this:

        $ bril2json < bench.bril | python3 tdce.py | bril2txt

  * Next, try using `wc` to check static code size differences:

        $ bril2json < bench.bril | wc -l
        $ bril2json < bench.bril | python3 tdce.py | wc -l

  * Then profiling to measure dynamic instruction count:

        $ bril2json < bench.bril | brili -p 5
        $ bril2json < bench.bril | python3 tdce.py | brili -p 5

You can see my implementation in `tdce.py` in [the examples directory][ex] in the Bril repository.

### Local Value Numbering

* Local value numbering.
  * Consider the common thread between dead code elimination (DCE), copy propagation, and common subexpression elimination. In some compilers classes/textbooks, these are all individual optimizations.
  * Value numbering is a general framework for understanding & optimizing computations.
  * If you can deeply understand the mystical metaphysics of value numbering, you will have gotten most of what you need to get out of this part of 6120.
* Extending LVN.
  * LVN can subsume constant folding, copy propagation, and algebraic identities. You will need to extend it with language semantics.
  * Write complete pseudocode for the base LVN algorithm, and work out where the "extension points" need to be to capture those optimizations.

You can see my implementation in `lvn.py` in [the examples directory][ex] in the Bril repository. But seriously, don't be tempted! You want to write your implementation without looking at mine!

## Tasks

* Implement "trivial" dead code elimination, in which you delete instructions that are never used before they are reassigned. Remember to iterate to convergence. (This should not take you long.)
* Implement local value numbering. Make sure it eliminates some common subexpressions. Try pairing it with trivial dead code elimination as a post-processing step. (This might take you quite a while.)
* In your README, briefly write up the evidence you have that your LVN implementation is correct and actually optimizes programs.
* For bonus "points," extend your LVN implementation to optimize the trickier examples given in class.
