## Gist

* Derive algorithms for simple dead code elimination: deleting globally unused instructions and locally "killed" instructions.
* Local vs. global reasoning.
* Local value numbering.
  * Consider the common thread between dead code elimination (DCE), copy propagation, and common subexpression elimination.
  * Value numbering is a general framework for understanding & optimizing computations.
  * If you can deeply understand the mystical metaphysics of value numbering, you will have gotten most of what you need to get out of this part of 6120.
* Extending LVN.
  * LVN can subsume constant folding, copy propagation, and algebraic identities. You will need to extend it with language semantics.
  * Write complete pseudocode for the base LVN algorithm, and work out where the "extension points" need to be to capture those optimizations.


## Tasks

* Implement "trivial" dead code elimination, in which you delete instructions that are never used before they are reassigned. Remember to iterate to convergence.
* Implement local value numbering. Make sure it eliminates some common subexpressions. Try pairing it with trivial dead code elimination as a post-processing step.
* For bonus "points," extend your LVN implementation to optimize the trickier examples given in class.
