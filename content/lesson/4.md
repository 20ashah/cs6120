## Gist

* The data flow framework.
  * *Reaching definitions* are an example of a global property that require you to look at an entire CFG.
  * Terminology: definition, use, available, kills.
  * The data flow framework.
  * Instantiating the the data flow framework for reaching definitions.
  * The worklist algorithm for solving data flow.
* Instantiating data flow.
  * The requirements for a general data flow analysis.
  * Demonstrating a simple generic implementation.
  * More examples of things you can do with the data flow framework.

## Tasks

* Implement at least one data flow analysis. You choose which.
* For bonus “points,” implement a generic solver that supports multiple analyses.
