## Tasks

- Follow the synthesis tutorial in your favorite language to build a sketch-based expression synthesis engine. You can use Z3 directly, as in Adrian's tutorial, or try [Rosette][], as in James Bornholt's tutorial.
- Add an extension to generate more complex expressions than the ternary and bit-shift expressions from the tutorial.
