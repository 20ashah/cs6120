* Recall from [Lesson 5][l5]: identifying *natural loops* in the CFG.
* Loop optimization is important because programs, by definition, spend most of their time executing loops! (A program without any loops can't run for very long.)

### Loop-Invariant Code Motion

Also from [Lesson 5][l5], recall the *loop-invariant code motion* optimization, which transforms code like this:

    let a = ...;
    let b = ...;
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        f(a * b);
    }

Into this, by moving code that does the same thing on every iteration to the loop's *pre-header* block:

    let a = ...;
    let b = ...;
    let c = a * b;
    for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        f(c);
    }

### Induction Variable Elimination

*Induction variable elimination* is an optimization that generally targets array indexing (and similar computations).
Imagine this loop that accesses an array:

    for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        f(a[i]);
    }

which, in C terms, is equivalent to:

    for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        f(a + i * stride);
    }

where `a` is a base pointer and `stride` is the size of the array's elements.
Induction variable elimination rewrites the code to just "bump the pointer" instead of multiplying every time:

    let a_100 = a + 100 * stride;
    for (let a_i = a; a_i < a_100; a_i += stride) {
        f(a_i);
    }

This code only has to do an addition in the loop—it has eliminated a multiplication.

The basic idea is to find *affine* expressions like `a + i * stride` that depend on a loop induction variable (`i` here) and some loop-invariant values (`a` and `stride` here).
Here's the recipe:

* Given a natural loop, identify the *basic* loop induction variable(s), like `i` in this example.
    * These are variables that get have a single in-loop definition that looks like `i += c` for some loop-invariant value `c`.
    * Of course, there is no such thing as `+=` in SSA form so identifying this kind of assignment requires traversing ϕ-nodes.
* Find *derived* induction variables.
    * You're looking for an affine expression like `j = c * i + d` where `i` is a basic induction variable and `c` and `d` are loop-invariant values.
    * Record the stride `c`, offset `d`, and the basic induction variable `i` for every induction variable you find this way.
* Replace the definition of each derived induction variable.
    * Assuming the induction variable is `j = c * i + d` where `i` is a basic induction variable that gets updated like `i += e`…
    * In the preheader, initialize `j` with the initial value of `i`.
    * In the loop (after the update to `i`), replace the definition of `j` with an update like `j += c * e` (where that latter multiplication is a loop-invariant value). (And again, this will look a bit different in SSA. And in non-SSA form, you will need to be careful to compute the new value of `j` right after the update to `i` but without clobbering other, pre-update uses of `j`.)

After all this, you'll want to do some copy propagation and dead code elimination to, for example, eliminate basic induction variables that are no longer necessary.

This optimization is also sometimes called *strength reduction* for induction variables (but I think that's confusing because strength reduction is a much more general concept that doesn't by itself have anything to do with loops).
For more, check out [some slides from CMU on induction variable elimination][cmu-iv] and two blog posts that cover this topic from CS 6120 in 2019:

### Loop Unswitching

Loop unswitching "lifts" conditions out of loops, creating two loops.
So this code:

    for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
        if (c) {  // Loop-invariant value.
            f();
        } else {
            g();
        }
    }

Becomes:

    if (c) {
        for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
            f();
        }
    } else {
        for (let i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
            g();
        }
    }

The analysis, of course, requires identifying loop-invariant code.
Then the heavily lifting in the transformation is "just" rearranging the CFG and duplicating the loop's subgraph.

## Tasks

Your task is to implement and evaluate a loop optimization.

* First, pick Bril or LLVM as your starting point. You can work in the SSA form of Bril if you want.
* Then, pick your optimization. Choose one of these, or propose your own (and DM me on Zulip before you start working on it to clear any ideas not on this list):
    * Loop-invariant code motion.
    * Induction variable strength reduction.
* Implement your optimization.
* Rigorously evaluate its performance impact. See the [SIGPLAN empirical evaluation guidelines][eeg] for the definition of "rigorous."
    * In Bril, you can use [the Bril benchmarks][bench].
    * If you choose LLVM, select an existing (small!) benchmark suite such as [Embench][].
