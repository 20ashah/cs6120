## Gist

* Recall: natural loops and loop-invariant code motion, from [Lesson 5][l5].
* Global value numbering?
* Induction variable optimizations & strength reduction.
* Lazy code motion.

## Tasks

* Pick one of LICM, induction variable strength reduction, and lazy code motion and implement it.
* Run your optimization on [the Bril benchmarks][bench] to check that it is correct and improves performance.
