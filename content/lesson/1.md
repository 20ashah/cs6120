## Gist

* Welcome to CS 6120! I'm really excited for the semester.
* 6120 is kind of an experimental course anyway, and this semester it's going to be even weirder. We're trying a mostly-[flipped][] model where the synchronous portion is primarily about quietly hacking and asking questions, and the primary content delivery mechanism consists of lessons like the one you're looking at now.


## Tasks

* Read the syllabus! Seriously, please [actually read it][s].
* [Sign up for Zulip][zulip-signup] and introduce yourself in [the introductions topic][intro].
