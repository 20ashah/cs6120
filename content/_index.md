## Apocalypse Logistics

This fall, CS 6120 is an **async-first, online, flipped-classroom smorgasbord of instructional experiences**.
The actual content comes in the form of videos, notes, and [Zulip][] chat.
We will use the synchronous class time mostly for hacking and asking questions, whether you're in person or participating virtually.
Synchronous virtual attendance is recommended; asynchronous participation and discussion is required.
There are no exams in this course, in-person or otherwise.

If you want to "shop" this course, please [sign up for Zulip][zulip-signup] to participate virtually.
If you're on the waitlist, please just wait—you'll get a PIN automatically, eventually.
Please read the [syllabus][] for more details on how everything works.
