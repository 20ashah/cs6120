# CS 6120: Advanced Compilers γ Syllabus

This is a research-oriented PhD course about programming language implementation.
The class focuses on hacking, reading papers, and writing [blog][] posts.


## Communication

Please [sign up][zulip-signup] for the [course Zulip][zulip].
All course communication will happen there (not on email).

## The Work

There are four kinds of things that make up the coursework for CS 6120.

* *Implementation tasks:*
  Discrete bits of compiler implementation work to deepen your understanding of the topics in the [lessons][].
* *Paper reading:*
  We'll read research papers, and everybody will participate in online discussion.
* *Leading paper discussions:*
  For a subset of the aforementioned research papers, you'll be responsible for writing a [blog][] post and leading the online discussion.
* *Course project:*
  There is an open-ended course implementation project that culminates in a blog post.

### Implementation Tasks

To reinforce the specific compiler techniques we learn about in class, you will work on implementing them on your own.
The usual pattern is that we will come up with the high-level idea and the pseudocode in lessons; your job is to turn it into real, working code and collect empirical evidence that it's working.
Going through the complete implementation will teach you about realities that you cannot get by thinking at a high level.

You can work individually or in groups of 2–3 students.
When you finish an implementation, do this:

* I recommend (but do not require) that you put all your code online in an open-source source code repository, e.g., on GitHub.
* Include a short README (just a paragraph is fine) describing what you did and how you know your implementation works.
* Submit the assignment on [CMS][]. Just submit a text file with a URL to your open-source implementation if it's available. If you for some reason don't want to open-source your code, you can instead upload the code itself.

### Paper Reading & Discussion

One part of the “work” in CS 6120 is about reading and understanding research papers.
For some small subset of the classes, you will be the [discussion leader][discussion].
The discussion leader has two main responsibilities: writing a blog post and facilitating the in-class discussion.

### Course Project

At the end of the course, you'll do a language implementation research project.
This is an open-ended and open-source project that can be on any topic that you can construe as being about compiler hacking.
The final product is an experience report on the [course blog][blog] where you rigorously evaluate the success of your implementation.

## Grading

I will grade the four categories of coursework based on a [Michelin star][michelin] system:
you should shoot for one star, indicating excellent implementation work, insightful participation, a thoughtful blog post, or a spectacularly successful project.
Merely acceptable work will receive no stars, and extraordinary work can receive multiple stars.
On [CMS][], all assignments are out of one point, indicating the number of stars.

Consistently earning a Michelin star will get you an A for the course.
Occasional multi-star work yields an A+, and missing stars leads to incrementally lower grades.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity

Absolute integrity is expected of all Cornell students in every academic undertaking. The course staff will prosecute violations aggressively.

You are responsible for understanding these policies:

- <a href="http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity</a>
- <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ugrad/CSMajor/index.htm#ai">Computer Science Department Code of Academic Integrity</a>

You can also read about the [protocol for prosecution of violations][aiproceedings].

[aiproceedings]: http://www.theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/AcadInteg/index.html

Everything you turn in must be ether 100% completely your own work or clearly attributed to someone else.
You may discuss your work with other students, look for help online, get writing feedback from the instructor, ask your friend to help debug something, or anything else that doesn't involve someone else doing your work for you.
You may not turn in any writing that you did not do yourself or misrepresent existing implementation work as your own.

The projects in this course are open source, and you may use existing code in your implementation—including code written by other students in this course. You must, however, make it clear which code is yours and which code is borrowed from where.

### Respect in Class

Everyone—the instructor, TAs, and students—must be respectful of everyone else in this class. All communication, in class and online, will be held to a high standard for inclusiveness: it may never target individuals or groups for harassment, and it may not exclude specific groups. That includes everything from outright animosity to the subtle ways we phrase things and even our timing.

For example: do not talk over other people; don't use male pronouns when you mean to refer to people of all genders; avoid explicit language that has a chance of seeming inappropriate to other people; and don't let strong emotions get in the way of calm, scientific communication.

If any of the communication in this class doesn't meet these standards, please don't escalate it by responding in kind. Instead, contact the instructor as early as possible. If you don't feel comfortable discussing something directly with the instructor—for example, if the instructor is the problem—please contact the advising office or the department chair.

### Special Needs and Wellness

We provide accommodations for disabilities.
Students with disabilities can contact <a href="http://sds.cornell.edu">Student Disability Services</a> at
607-254-4545 or the instructor for a confidential discussion of their
individual needs.

If you experience personal or academic stress or need to talk to someone who can help, contact the instructor or:
